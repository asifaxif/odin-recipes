    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1>This peri peri chicken recipe features a great spicy marinade for an African dish that's great for a barbecue.</p1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup paprika</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hot chili powder</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 bone-in chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together lemon juice, paprika, chili powder, garlic, ginger, and salt in a large bowl until well combined. Add chicken; rub until well coated and marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat a grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grates.</li>
        <li>Place chicken onto the preheated grill; discard marinade. Cook, turning occasionally, until skins are slightly charred and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
