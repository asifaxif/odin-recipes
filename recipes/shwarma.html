        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cardamom</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grill seasoning (such as Montreal Steak SeasoningÂ®)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced, divided</li>
            <li>1 large clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
            <li>1 yellow bell pepper, sliced</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup tahini</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>4 pita bread rounds</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an indoor or outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Whisk together the coriander, cumin, cardamom, chili powder, grill seasoning, paprika, and turmeric in a bowl; whisk in juice of 1/2 lemon, garlic, and 3 tablespoons olive oil to form a paste. Coat the chicken breasts with the spice paste.</li>
            <li>Grill chicken breasts on the preheated grill until juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink at the center, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and cool for 1 to 2 minutes; slice thinly.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir onion, red pepper, and yellow pepper into the hot olive oil; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir together Greek yogurt, tahini, juice of remaining 1/2 lemon, and remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in a bowl until smooth; season with salt.</li>
            <li>Place pitas on the grill until heated through and lightly charred on the outside, about 1 minute per side. To assemble each sandwich, place some sliced chicken on each pita; top with some of the pepper mixture and a good dollop of yogurt tahini sauce.</li>
        </ol>
